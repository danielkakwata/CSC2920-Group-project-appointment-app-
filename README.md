This document entails the details of a visual studio program that will be used to schedule and view appointments. 
The goal is to have a visual program that allows a user to set 
and view appointments for ease of use. The user will be able to add themselves 
to an appointment list as well as view and remove themselves at their discretion. 
There will also be the functionality of a login/registry further down the line in development.
